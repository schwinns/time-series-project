# Forecasting PSCO Energy Demand

**Final project for MATH 5540 - Time Series**

This repository contains all notebooks, LaTeX, and figures to generate the report on forecasting the hourly energy demand for Colorado.

The notebooks are as follows:
* `explore_cenpy.ipynb` and `explore_meteostat.ipynb` are exploratory analysis for navigating the API and new Python packages.
* `get_data.ipynb` retrieves all the data necessary for the forecast.
* `preprocessing.ipynb` removes outliers, fills missing data, and scales the data.
* `modeling.ipynb` performs regression modeling and ARIMA modeling to forecast future energy demand.

A short report is included in `MATH_5540_project.pdf`
